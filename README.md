# Commodore VIC 20 Kernal Debug Tool | 6502 Emulator


As I continue in my adventures in retro computing with Commodore VIC 20, I am wanting to learn the internals for the VIC 20 
Kernal. To help me with this task, I have written a JavaScript program that loads an image of the Kernal ROM and allows me 
to step through the code as if I was in a debugger. This tool provides visual feedback of the registers and memory as each 
line of the assembly code is executed. 

The video below is a quick demo of this tool.
